# RADx-Search

Spring Boot 3 microservice for RADx Data Hub 3.0. It is running on Java 17.

# Install and Run

## Maven

### Local

There are a few environment variable that need to be set:
* SEARCH_HOST
  * Hostname of Opensearch cluster
* SEARCH_USERNAME
  * Open Search username for basic auth
* SEARCH_PASSWORD
  * Open Search password for basic auth
* SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
  * This should be set to 'local'
* HostURL
  * hostname of the radx data hub system

I typically just set these via my environment variables in IntelliJ.

Once the environment variables are set:
```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
Once all classes are generated, you can run the application with maven or via the application context.
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Cloud

If running locally, AWS CLI needs to be installed and configured.

There are a few environment variable that need to be set in AWS Secrets Manager:
* opensearch.hostname
    * Open Search hostname / url
* opensearch.port
    * Port on which Open Search is accepting connections
* opensearch.scheme
    * Scheme type on which Open Search is accepting connections
* opensearch.username
    * Open Search username for basic auth
* opensearch.password
    * Open Search password for basic auth
* HostURL
  * hostname of the radx data hub system

In a specific instance, the only environment variable that needs to be set is:
* SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
    * This should be set to '{environment}'
      * The current environments are dev, test, prod

Once the environment variables are set:
```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
Once all classes are generated, you can run the application with maven or via the application context.
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
